This code treats the range of integers between 0 and n as the set of possible
solutions and then does a binary search over that range.  Because the range
is cut in half with each loop, the time complexity is O(log(n)).  The space
complexity is also O(log(n)) because the recursion stack will have, at most,
log(n) iterations.  There is no space associated with a data structure.
