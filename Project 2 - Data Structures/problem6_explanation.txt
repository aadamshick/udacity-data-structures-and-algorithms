I leveraged a dictionary for both the union and intersection operators. The dictionary
is an appropriate data structure because it enforces the uniqueness that is necessary
for these set operations.  Union and Intersection both run in time complexity O(n),
where n is the average length of the two lists.  The space complexity is O(n), because
the keys are only stored in a single dictionary, even for union.
