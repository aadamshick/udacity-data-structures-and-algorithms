I leveraged a custom block class and a custom blockchain class, that has very
similar properties to a linked list.  The main function, add_new_block, runs in 
O(1) time, since it simply appends a new block to the head, and tags the previous
block in the block class attribute.  The space complexity is O(n), where n is the
total number of blocks that are created.
