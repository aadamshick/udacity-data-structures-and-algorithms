I leveraged a python list (i.e. dynamic array) along with a recursive algorithm
to search the directory.  The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the
total number of files and folders in the subdirectory.  It needs to perform an 
exhaustive search in order to find all instances of the suffix, and this requires
scanning every file and folder in the subdirectory.  The algorithm runs in O(m) space
complexity, where m is the maximum of either a) the number of files in the largest
folder in the subdirectory, or b) the number of files matching the suffix condition.
