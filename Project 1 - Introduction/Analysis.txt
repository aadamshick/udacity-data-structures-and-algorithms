Task 0:

O(2) - regardless of the size of input, there are only two operations, getting the first and the last record


Task 1:

O(4n) - assuming the list of texts and calls are each of length n, then you have to traverse each list
twice to get the initial list of phone numbers, and then traverse that final list (of worst-case length
2n) when creating the final set.

Task 2:

O(3n) - you traverse the calls list once to get the phone numbers, and then you traverse the list of phone
numbers (worst case length 2n) to get the maximum time.

Task 3:

O(nlogn + 2n) - you need to traverse the calls list once (n), then you need to sort the to phone numbers (nlogn),
and then you need to print out the sorted phone numbers (worst case length n)

Task 4:

O(9n) - you create 4 sets, apply 3 set operations, apply 1 sort operation, and then apply 1 for loop, each
taking n iterations
