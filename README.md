# udacity-data-structures-and-algorithms

These projects were submitted by Andrew Adamshick as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree At Udacity.

As part of Udacity Honor code, your submissions must be your own work, hence
submitting this project as yours will cause you to break the Udacity Honor Code
and the suspension of your account.

Me, the author of the project, allow you to check the code as a reference, but if
you submit it, it's your own responsibility if you get expelled.
